            "answer": "MAH MBA CET is a moderately difficult exam. It’s difficulty level is lower than CAT but higher than MAT or ATMA. A major factor that makes MAH CET a difficult test to crack is that the questions are presented in random order and sectional weightage vary in every slot. So, candidates cannot anticipate or plan how many and which type of questions to get to their target score. Also, the MAH MBA CET is dominated by Logical Reasoning questions and there are comparatively less Quantitative Aptitude questions. Since, there is no set pattern, candidates cannot pre-plan. They need to make a strategy and implement it as soon as they see the question paper. So, those who can think on their feet and can crack the exam better than others."
